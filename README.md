## About:books:
The application generates a publication for the "VK" public containing the text of congratulations, the names of the group members with links to their profiles and a 
collage of profile photos. A series of GET-requests are made to the "VK" API, as a result of which it is possible to obtain information about users whose birthday is, 
after which the generated publication is sent with a POST-request to the proposed news for confirmation by the administrator.
